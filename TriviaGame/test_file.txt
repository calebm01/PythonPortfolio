2
Using simple subtraction, we can determine that 25-9 is 16
Subtraction
What is 4-9?
1. 5
2. 0
3. -5
4. -1
3
Moving into subtraction problems that take us into numbers less than 0, we can find that 4-9 is -5
Multiplication
What is 12*12?
1. 52
2. 24
3. 144
4. 56
3
Using multiplication tables learned in 3rd grade, we can determine that 12*12 is 144 (just add it to itself 12 times)
Exponents
What is 2^3? (2 to the 3rd power)
1. 2
2. 4
3. 6
4. 8
4
If we multiply 2 by itself three times, we can determine that 2 to the 3rd power is 8

What is 9-5/(8-3)*2+6? (No calculators)
1. 16
2. 9
3. 13
4. 2
3
Using PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) We can determine that the answer is 13
Slope
If a graph's points are determined by going up 4 points, and then going over 2 points, what is the slope?
1. 2/4
2. 2
3. 5
4. 3
2
By using rise over run, we can determine that the answer is 4/2, which simplifies to 2
Deriving
What is the derivative of 6x^3?
1. 18x^2
2. 3/2x^4
3. 30
4. 144
1
To find a derivative, we multiply the number out front by the exponent, then subtract the exponent by 1
Python
Why does math help us understand Python?
1. It doesn't
2. Because computer do math good
3. It helps us understand the fundamental Python syntax
4. Because Python sucks
3
Math is used in python constantly to help programs understand what they need to do, the syntax uses math to do an unlimited number of things.
